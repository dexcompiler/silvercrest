# Silvercrest

Silvercrest is strongly-typed Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for interacting with Solana blockchain data and is written in F#. This library provides a safe, functional, and composable way to query and analyze Solana chain data using F#'s powerful type system and computation expressions.

## Features

- ðŸ”’ **Type-safe**: Leverage F#'s type system to prevent runtime errors when working with Solana data
- ðŸš€ **High Performance**: Efficient batching and caching strategies for optimal data retrieval
- ðŸ§© **Composable**: Built using F# computation expressions for elegant and maintainable queries
- ðŸ”„ **web3.js Integration**: Seamless interop with Solana's official web3.js library
- ðŸ’ª **Strong Abstractions**: Domain-specific operations that compose well and are easy to reason about

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Silvercrest  # Coming soon
